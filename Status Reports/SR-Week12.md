## ADE- Additional Log Support

### Project Members:

1. Ayush Shridhar - Mentee
2. Jim Caffrey - Mentor

### Accomplishments of the week:

1. Implemented FlowLayoutSpark.xml, FlowLayoutSpark.xsd
2. Added two new parameters to the setup file: ade.useSparkLogs, ade.flowLayoutFileSpark and ade.analysisGroupToFlowNameMapperClassSpark, which get triggered only if the first parameter is explicitly
set to true.

### Milestones:

1. Implemented most of the Analysis and Flow modules.

### Issues:

1. There is no process id present within Spark logs: awaiting new logs that contain id.
