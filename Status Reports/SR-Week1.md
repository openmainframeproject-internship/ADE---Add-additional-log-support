## ADE- Additional Log Support

### Project Members:

1. Ayush Shridhar - Mentee
2. Jim Caffrey - Mentor

### Accomplishemnts of the week:

The plan was to get an idea of ADE internals and understand the flow of the project. 
Additionally, we'd like to look at the best way to incorporate new logs here. Since
ADE was built with Syslogs in mind, there can be a few ways we can introduce new logs.
(Hard code within ADE, add as a new parameter in setup file).

### Milestones:

1. Read throught ADE intenals and documentation: Done
2. Realise the best approach to add new logs: Done
