## ADE- Additional Log Support

### Project Members:

1. Ayush Shridhar - Mentee
2. Jim Caffrey - Mentor

### Accomplishments of the week:

Setup ADE locally and get a toy model working on mock dataset.

### Milestones:

1. Install Java-8, maven, Apache Derby and build the project. Done
2. Run scripts to get ADE working on mock datasets. Done
3. ADE tests pass now. Tweaking a few tests cases fixes the issue.

### Issues:

1. Future work: Might want to look into Updating ade to Java-11, thus making it
usable with latest jdk tools and newer versions of Apache Derby.
